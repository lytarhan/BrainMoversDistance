This directory contains code for the second use case: constructing a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) based on how similarly a specific brain region responds to different stimuli. 

Demo data for this code may be available at the Open Science Framework repository for this project: https://osf.io/m9ac3, but if not I've included instructions at the head of the first script for how to format your own data to try out the code yourself.
