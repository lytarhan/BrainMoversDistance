# BrainMoversDistance
This repository contains code demonstrating the use of Wasserstein Distance to calculate neural dissimilarities. The code here was developed by Leyla Tarhan & Evan Fields.

There are two worked examples:
1. Assessing the replicability (or inter-subject reliability) of your fMRI data using Wasserstein Distance.
2. Assessing the Representational Similarity of neural responses in a specific brain region (a.k.a. Representational Similarity Analysis).

Example data for these two examples can be downloaded from the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/m9ac3/

For more information on the theory behind Brain-Mover's Distance, see this blog post on my website: http://lytarhan.rbind.io/post/content/post/brain-mover-s-distance/
